    <div class="row"><h1>Specialty Areas (Computer Engineering)</h1></div>
    <div class="row"><h3>Coding, cryptography, and information protection</h3></div>
    <div class="row"><p>Computer engineers work in coding, cryptography, and information protection to develop new methods for protecting various information, such as digital images and music, fragmentation, copyright infringement and other forms of tampering. Examples include work on wireless communications, multi-antenna systems, optical transmission, and digital watermarking</p></div>
    <div class="row"><h3>Communications and wireless networks</h3></div>
    <div class="row"><p>Those focusing on communications and wireless networks, work advancements in telecommunications systems and networks (especially wireless networks), modulation and error-control coding, and information theory. High-speed network design, interference suppression and modulation, design, and analysis of fault-tolerant system, and storage and transmission schemes are all a part of this specialty.</p></div>
    <div class="row"><h3>Compilers and Operating Systems</h3></div>
    <div class="row"><p>This specialty focuses on compilers and operating systems design and development. Engineers in this field develop new operating system architecture, program analysis techniques, and new techniques to assure quality. Examples of work in this field include post-link-time code transformation algorithm development and new operating system development.</p></div>
    <div class="row"><h3>Computational science and Engineering</h3></div>
    <div class="row"><p>Computational Science and Engineering is a relatively new discipline. According to the Sloan Career Cornerstone Center, individuals working in this area, "computational methods are applied to formulate and solve complex mathematical problems in engineering and the physical and the social sciences. Examples include aircraft design, the plasma processing of nanometer features on semiconductor wafers, VLSI circuit design, radar detection systems, ion transport through biological channels, and much more".</p></div>
    <div class="row"><h3>Computer networks, mobile computing, and distrubuted systems</h3></div>
    <div class="row"><p>In this specialty, engineers build integrated environments for computing, communications, and information access. Examples include shared-channel wireless networks, adaptive resource management in various systems, and improving the quality of service in mobile and ATM environments. Some other examples include work on wireless network systems and fast Ethernet cluster wired systems.</p></div>
    <div class="row"><h3>Computer Systems: Architecture, Parallel processing and Dependability.</h3></div>
    <div class="row"><p>Engineers working in computer systems work on research projects that allow for reliable, secure, and high-performance computer systems. Projects such as designing processors for multi-threading and parallel processing are included in this field. Other examples of work in this field include development of new theories, algorithms, and other tools that add performance to computer systems.</p></div>
    <div class="row"><h3>COmputer Vision and Robotics</h3></div>
    <div class="row"><p>In this specialty, computer engineers focus on developing <b>visual sensing technology</b> to sense an environment, representation of an environment, and manipulation of the environment. The gathered three-dimensional information is then implemented to perform a variety of tasks. Thses include improved human modeling, image communication, and human-interfaces, as well as devices such as special-purpose cameras with versatile vision sensors.</p></div>
    <div class="row"><h3>Embedded Systems</h3></div>
    <div class="row"><p>Individuals working in this area design technology for enhancing the speed, reliability, and performance of systems. Embedded systems are found in many devices from a small FM radio to the space shuttle. According to the Sloan Cornerstone Career Center, ongoing developments in embedded systems include "automated vehicles and equipment to conduct search and rescue, automated transportation systems, and human-robot coordination to repair equipment in space." As of 2018, computer embedded computer engineering specializations include system-on-chip design, architecture of edge computing and the Internet of things.</p>
